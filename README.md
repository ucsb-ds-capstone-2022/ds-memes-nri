In this exercise, we'll practice editing the same file in a small groups.  Here are your instructions:

1. As a group in zoom decide which issue (from 1 to 5) each of you will take.
2. Individually, create an issue and assign that issue to yourself on github.
3. Create a branch where you will make your changes.
4. After making the change, open a pull request.
5. Return to your group and review the pull requests of your teammates and merge the pull requests.
6. View the final markdown on github!


For your issue, add your name and embed the image using the syntax `![](image_url)` replacing "image_url" with the appropriate url. When done you should see the image in place of "ADD IMAGE HERE. URL is ..."
